# Term Deposit Prediction Project

This project predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaign data using machine learning techniques.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Dataset:** 41,188 client records with 20 features
- **Target:** Binary classification (subscribe: yes/no)
- **Success Rate:** 11.3% subscription rate (imbalanced dataset)
- **Data Quality:** Complete dataset with 0% missing values

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup the environment:
```bash
python setup_and_run.py
```

### 2. Run the complete analysis:
```bash
python term_deposit_prediction.py
```

### 3. Run the simple version (for quick testing):
```bash
python simple_prediction.py
```

## üìã What This Project Does

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Comprehensive data quality assessment
- Statistical analysis of 41,188 client records
- Outlier detection and feature distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis between features

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Label encoding for 10 categorical variables
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Stratified train-test split (80/20)
- Class balancing for imbalanced dataset

### 3. **Model Development**
- **Algorithms:** Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold stratified CV
- **Model selection:** Based on F1-score (optimal for imbalanced data)
- **Performance metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Comprehensive performance metrics
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations
- Feature importance analysis
- Model comparison and selection

### 5. **Business Insights & Recommendations**
- Client segmentation analysis
- Campaign optimization strategies
- Actionable recommendations for marketing team
- ROI improvement suggestions

## üìà Key Findings

### Client Demographics
- **Job Distribution:** Admin (25.3%), Blue-collar (22.5%), Technician (16.4%)
- **Education:** University degree holders (29.5%) most common
- **Contact Preference:** Cellular (63.5%) vs Telephone (36.5%)
- **Campaign Timing:** May campaigns most frequent (33.4%)

### Success Factors
- **Call Duration:** Strong predictor of subscription success
- **Economic Indicators:** Significant impact on campaign outcomes
- **Contact Frequency:** Optimal range of 1-3 contacts per campaign
- **Previous Success:** Strong predictor for future subscriptions
